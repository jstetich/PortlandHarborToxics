#  Source of Data in 'Final_Data_Transmittal'

Received in e-mail from Michael Johnson of Stantec, dated February 4, 2020.
Data originally collected by Glenn Daukas of Campbell Environmental

## Cite Report as Follows:
>Cambell Environmental Group, Inc. 2019.  Bulk Chemistry Dredge Sediment Sampling
and Harbor Assessment Report, Portland Harbor, Portland and South Portland,
Maine. Report Prepared For Portland Harbor Commission, Maine Trade Center, Suite 105,
Portland Fish Pier, Portland, ME 04101.

In an e-mail from August 28, 2020, Glenn Daukis of Campbell Scientific replied to a 
question from Curtis C. Bohlen: "I believe the results are dry weight but I will 
have to check with the lab to be 100%."

# Other  Information
## Screening Values
We found a plethora of potential screenign values in  NOAA's SQuiRT Cards 
(Screening Quick Reference Tables), which are available multiple places on-line 
including here: https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/9327

Supplementary information on the SQuiRTs is available here:
https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/environmental-restoration/environmental-assessment-tools/squirt-cards-faq.html

Similar screening levels are available in "Sediment Quality Guidelines"
developed for the National Status and Trends Program":
https://www.coastalscience.noaa.gov/publications/handler.aspx?key=1527

Selection of ERM and ERL as the primary criteria of interest related to use of 
those screening criteria in a recent Casco Bay Sediment Quality report,
available through the CBEP website.

## Alternate Screening values
We  explored screening values based on concentrations of contaminants
expressed on a per unit organic matter basis.  Much work has suggested that 
toxicity of many contaminants is more closely related to concentrations
expressed on an organic matter basis rather than on a dry weight or wet weight 
basis.

We found published screening values expressed on an organic matter basis from 
Washington State:
> Department of Ecology, Washington State. 2013. Sediment Management Standards
Chapter 173-204 WAC. Revised February 2013, Effective September 2013.
Publication no. 13-09-055
(Available several places online, including:
(https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-12/documents/wa-chapter173-204.pdf)).

A  related technical summary is available here:
> Teresa C Michelsen, Ph.D. 1992,  Technical Information Memorandum. Organic 
Carbon Normalization of Sediment Data. Washington Department of Ecology
Sediment Management Unit.  December 1992. Publication No. 05-09-050
(https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/publications/SummaryPages/0509050.html)

Comparisons to those screening values were not included in final analysis and
graphics.

## List of PCB congeners
PCB nomenclature is confusing.  EPA provides a nice summary of alternate ways
PCBs can be denoted here:
https://www.epa.gov/pcbs/table-polychlorinated-biphenyl-pcb-congeners
The table used to convert among different terminologies was copied 
and pasted into Word from the PDF available at that web site. Because we focus on 
total PCBs, the nomenclature table was not used directly here.
